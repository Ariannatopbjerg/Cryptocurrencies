# Cryptocurrencies

## Project Purpose
To determine which crypotcurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment. 

Since the data that was given has no known output, I will be using unsupervised learning and group the cryptocurrencies using a clustering algorithm. 

## Analysis Layout:
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
